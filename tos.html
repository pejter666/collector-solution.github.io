If clients use fraudulent software, they do so at their own risk and in the full knowledge that if a ban is obtained from the server-admin or anticheats, no one other than the client will be held liable (getting a cheating or violation ban). The function of our software is to be used on playful purpose. This has to take place on private servers. In the case that clients (user, member) use our software in a different function as the software was created, Collector-Solutions is not accountable for that. Clients (user, member) have to accept own responsibility for this change of the main purpose. The only condition to practice with our software for free is that the client has to have a membership. The software are only constructed for one single computer, no more. To produce an inimitably hardware ID we use different parts of your computer (e.g. processor, memory, hard drive). It is entirely possible that clients rework the hardware ID to utilize our product on another private computer. Our company reserves the right that this process may incur costs. These potential costs depend whether our apparatus can identify the new hardware ID or not. Memberships called with "Lifetime" or "Lifetime Membership" is in reference to the lifetime of the website and not to the lifetime of the client (user, member).
